# Duber's-Revenge

The final project for ICS3U6 - grade 11 pre-AP Computer Science.

This project heavily focuses on OOP concepts, including inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

A top-down shooter survival game, designed by the team of three: Eric Miao, Kyle Zhou, Ethan Zhang.

Waves of different types of zombies spawn as Duber tries to survive as many waves as possible. Dead zombies drop loot such as bandaids, aid kits, or money for Duber to purchase different guns, ammo, or other accessories from the shop.
