# Duber's-Revenge

A top-down shooter survival game using exclusively java core libraries.

Waves of different types of zombies spawn as Duber tries to survive as many waves as possible. Dead zombies drop loot such as bandaids, aid kits, or money for Duber to purchase different guns, ammo, or other useful accessories from the shop. 

This project heavily focuses on OOP concepts, including inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
